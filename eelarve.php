        The Monthly Budget Planner in Excel was made as the last mandated excercise in office software automation class.<br>
        We were given no other instructions other than it had to be fully automated with macros and involve certain types of macros.<br>
        Though we had no design or function instructions, the planner still ended up quite featured for a basic macro-automated<br>
        budget planner. There exists 2 versions of the planner however - one which was done within the timelimit of the excercise<br>
        and a version 2 which incorporates the features i had to cut from the first and expands the featureset and functioning<br>
        of it based on the things made and learned in v1.<br>
        <br>
