        <br>
        The Monthly Budget Planner in Excel was made as the last mandated excercise in office software automation class.<br>
        We were given no other instructions other than it had to be fully automated with macros and involve certain types of macros.<br>
        Though we had no design or function instructions, the planner still ended up quite featured for a basic macro-automated<br>
        budget planner. There exists 2 versions of the planner however - one which was done within the timelimit of the excercise<br>
        and a version 2 which incorporates the features i had to cut from the first and expands the featureset and functioning<br>
        of it based on the things made and learned in v1.<br>
        <br>

        Version 2 was created after the original assignment for a few reasons - I didn't see version 1 as "complete" and wanted to<br>
        implement the cut features aswell as I actually had a need for those features myself to make using the planner as easy as<br>
        it was originally intended to.<br>
