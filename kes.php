    <p id="darkboxed">I am a long time fan and an average enjoyer of video games of allsorts. My affinity for <br>
        video games began at a young age when my older brother first introduced us to them through a device <br>
        that is currently known as a Famiclone, though then the colloquial name for it was "telekamäng". <br>
        <br>
        The game that finalised the hook for me was the NES classic called Super Mario Bros. Even though <br>
        it wasn't the first game i played, it was the one that stood out to me the most. It was the thing<br>
        that got me to question "Is there more out there?". Over the coming years and decades the world <br>
        of retro games opened up to me even more after my brother also brought home our first computer.<br>
        It was clear at that point what i wanted to do - Video Games.<br>
        <br>
        However, my journey here, to this point has been rather misguided. Since I had nobody to teach the <br>
        necessary skills to me, it has been quite hard, and over the years I've developed other adjacent <br>
        skills to programming a game, such as composing music and drawing level art in the styles I grew up <br>
        playing games of.
