    <p style="text-align: center;" id="darkboxed">Harold Harrison The Rabbit Warrior is a platformer idea I have had for many years, the project though, wasn't <br>
        started until I enrolled at THK to become a Junior Software Developer with the explicit goal of getting into game development.<br>
        The project has 2 time periods attached to its development. The idea origin and the rescoped origin.<br><br>
        The idea origin is the time before enrollment when the game was still just and idea. Since at the time I didn't know how to <br>
        code at all, I worked on the aspects of the game that I was able to do besides the code. These being the Graphics, Story, Music<br>
        and overall game plan. I worked on these aspects of the game since 2016. And even though not one of them reached the definition<br>
        of "Done", I did, by the enrollment time, have a lot of material to go off of and work with. I had the gist of the story, <br>
        Set number of enemy definitions, most of world 1 graphics which you see in the demo video above, around 40+ tracks of music<br>
        about half of which are fully complete, and the other half in various stages of completions, alongside some sound effects,<br>
        preliminary player graphics, other miscellaneous sprites and things, aswell as world 1 level layouts, world 1 graphics, some <br>
        world 2 and 3 graphics, predefined locations as per the story and a myriad of other tidbits.<br><br>
